# Coding Etiquette

The following rules should be upheld at all times when coding or working in this repo:
1. Include informative comments throughout your code, using the hashtag (`#`) symbol
2. Space out your code to make it easier to read (such as between operators (don't scrunch things together) and between lines of code)
3. Breakdown your work into sections by typing - four times (`----`) in RStudio next to a comment (this adds the #comment to an outline, making it easy to find each section)
4. Give informative names to all of your objects
5. Keep your code to under 100 characters in length per line (add guidance line as reference) 
7. When naming files, use `_` for spaces and try to avoid capital letters 
8. When naming folders, capitalize the first letter and try to avoid multiple words (use `_` for spaces if necessary)
